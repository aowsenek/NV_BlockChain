\chapter{Problem Statement}
\label{problemstate}
        The need for logging events in vehicular transport has long been necessary for accountability. Until recently, all vehicular logs have been recorded on paper, which is dependent on the integrity of recording parties. Nowadays, computers automatically log many events from gas mileage to GPS coordinates, but those logs are still vulnerable to bad actors modifying or deleting the data. This thesis aims to use blockchain technology to secure vehicular logs through tamper detection. 
        
        For Example, a manager of a fleet may want to modify data to look like they are not liable for an accident.
        
        The software guarantees: 
\begin{outline}
\1         Once the data has been received and entered into the blockchain the adversary cannot modify it
\1  Once the data has been entered into the blockchain the adversary cannot modify the order in which the data was inserted.
\1         There exists 1 and only 1 valid sequence, and the ally can detect if they have the correct sequence and if anything is missing from the sequence.

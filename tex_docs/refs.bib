The white paper for bitcoin's implementation. This is the inspiration for a blockchain logger but because bitcoin relies on a distributed network it is fundamentally different from a vehicular logchain, which is a single node.

This article is about a plain implementation of a blockchain-based log verification software. As far as I can tell it has not been implemented anywhere, and definitely not for vehicular logs.

This article is about a decentralized blockchain for protecting personal data. This article is about a bitcoin-based logging software for user data and privacy. This software is intended to provide a trusted decentralized log of whose data was accessed when, and this software could be quite interesting to explore with vehicle logs- the implementation is different but the idea is generally the same.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introchap}

This sample document illustrates how to use the
{\tt thesis} class, originally written by John P. Weiss.
Some requirements of the Graduate School are written
into that file; page size, line spacing, appropriate
placement of captions for tables and figures, etc.
Revisions by Hongcheng Ni make it possible to use the
(optional)
\verb2\usepackage{hyperref}2 command to enable
internal hyperlinks in the final PDF document.
Other tasks of conforming to the requirements are
left to other existing \LaTeX{} packages.
For example, a common problem is to insert graphics ---
figures and tables --- into the body of the thesis.  For
this one should use the {\tt graphicx} package, which is
part of the standard \TeX{} distribution.  Likewise, the
Grad School specs say that a large table may be displayed
in landscape mode at reduced size, but its caption must
also be in rotated position, in the same font and size as
the normal text in the body of the thesis.  To accomplish
this, the user must invoke the {\tt rotating} package,
available online.


Figure \ref{xfigDiagram} shows an image from a PDF file
imported into this document
using the \verb2graphicx2 package.
The command \verb2\usepackage{graphicx}2, which appears
near the very top of the main \LaTeX{} file, reads in
this package which defines the
\verb2\includegraphics{}2 macro.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\caption[Cylinder and measurements]{
	This diagram of a cylinder and various
	measurements and quantities was actually
	made using {\bf xfig}, a freeware
	drawing program for Unix systems.
	Diagrams can be exported directly to PDF
	files, the preferred format for
	vector graphics.  Vector graphics can
	be magnified indefinitely without degradation,
	whereas bitmap images (JPG and PNG)
	must be pretty high-resolution if you don't
	want them looking all pixellated when
	magnified.
	}

\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \caption[Bitmap images]{
	The JPEG bitmap format is great for photos but
	crummy for diagrams (including drawings, graphs,
	charts) because it can't gracefully handle sharp edges.
	Note the same bitmap image below from a PNG file and
	from a JPG file; the latter shows characteristic
	``ringing'' at sharp edges -- including text!
	Seriously, magnify and look closely at the JPG's
	awful lines and edges.
	Vector-format PDF is the best for diagrams, but
	if you must use a bitmap image, let it be PNG.

\section{Lists in {\tt thesis} class}

In {\tt thesis} class (for Colorado University),
lists are defined so that nested lists will be
numbered or marked appropriately.
First, an itemized (non-enumerated) list
prefaces each item with a bullet.
Nested itemized list use asterisks,
then dashes, then dots.
These lists are typed between
the \verb2\begin{itemize}2
and \verb2\end{itemize}2
commands.

\begin{itemize}
  \item{} This is ``itemized'' item A.
  \item{} This is ``itemized'' item B.
  \item{} This is ``itemized'' item C.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{} This is ``itemized'' subitem A.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{} This is ``itemized'' subsubitem A.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{} This is ``itemized'' subsubsubitem A.
      \end{itemize}
      \item{} This is ``itemized'' subsubitem B.
    \end{itemize}
    \item{} This is ``itemized'' subitem B.
  \end{itemize}
  \item{} This is ``itemized'' item D.
\end{itemize}

Enumerated lists use the commands
\verb2\begin{enumerate}2 and
\verb2\end{enumerate}2,
and nested enumerations appear like this.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{} This is ``enumerated'' item A.
  \item{} This is ``enumerated'' item B.
  \item{} This is ``enumerated'' item C.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{} This is ``enumerated'' subitem A.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item{} This is ``enumerated'' subsubitem A.
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item{} This is ``enumerated'' subsubsubitem A.
      \end{enumerate}
      \item{} This is ``enumerated'' subsubitem B.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item{} This is ``enumerated'' subitem B.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item{} This is ``enumerated'' item D.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Mathematical Formulation}
\label{mathchapter}

The objective of this fake thesis document is to demonstrate
a multitude of \LaTeX{} features as well as features specific
to the thesis class.
We start by giving one short formula,
and one big hairy multi-line formula
(one of the non-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations):

\begin{equation}
	A = \pi r^2
\end{equation}


\begin{eqnarray}
  \rho \left[ \frac{DV_r}{Dt} - M \epsilon^2
    \frac{\vth^2}{r} \right]
  & = & -\frac{\delta^2}{\gamma~ M} \diffr{P}
	+ \frac{M ~\delta^2}{Re} \left\{ 2 \diffr{}
	\left[ \mu \left( \diffr{V_r}
        - \frac{1}{3} {\bf \nabla \cdot \overline{V}}
      \right) \right] \right. \nonumber \\
  & & + \frac{1}{r} \diffth{} \left[ \mu \left(
      \frac{1}{r} \diffth{V_r} + \epsilon \diffr{\vth}
      - \epsilon \frac{\vth}{r} \right) \right] \nonumber \\
  & & + \diffz{} \left[ \mu \left( \frac{1}{\delta^2}
        \diffz{V_r} + \diffr{V_z} \right) \right] \nonumber \\
  & & + 2 \left. \frac{\mu}{r}\left[ \diffr{V_r} -\frac{\epsilon}{r}
      \diffth{\vth} - \frac{V_r}r\right] \right\}, \label{eq:rmom}
\end{eqnarray}


\section{Explanation of equations}

The latter equation is non-dimensionalized using the following definitions:

\[
	r = \frac{r'}{R'}, ~~~
	z = \frac{z'}{L'},~~~
	t = \frac{t'}{t_a'}, ~~~
	\kappa = \frac{\kappa'}{\kappa_0'}, ~~~
	\mu = \frac{\mu'}{\mu_0'} , ~~~
	C_V = \frac{C_V'}{C_{V0}'},
\]
where $P_0'$ is the initial static pressure in the cylinder,
and $\rho_0'$ and $T_0'$ are the density and temperature
of the fluid being injected from the sidewall.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \caption[Cutting up a triangular pyramid]{
	A triangular pyramid may be cut up as shown, to
	yield one top pyramid (with one-eighth the volume
	of the full pyramid), three bottom corner pyramids
	(which, when joined, are congruent to the top pyramid),
	three prisms along the bottom edges (the area of whose
	bottom faces total $B/2$) and the large central prism
	(volume = $(B/4)(h/2) = Bh/8$).
	The image, from PDF file ``pyr.pdf'',
	was read in using the {\tt $\backslash$includegraphics}
	command, from the {\tt graphicx} package.

\end{figure}


Here is an example of using the macros
\verb2\singlespacing2 and \verb2\doublespacing2:

\singlespacing	% <------------------------------

This paragraph was preceded by the
command \verb2\singlespacing2.
See the Specifications of the Grad School for instructions
about when single spacing is appropriate in a thesis.

\doublespacing	% <------------------------------

And now, here is an example of using the macros
\verb2\begin{singlespace}2 and \verb2\end{singlespace}2;
another way to get single-spacing.

\begin{singlespace}	% <-----------------------------
Two cases are studied in the present work which differ only in the
boundary conditions.  Each different boundary condition model a
different source of instability.  The boundary of the first case
consists of a steady, axisymmetric sidewall radial velocity boundary
and a time-dependent, non-axisymmetric endwall axial velocity
boundary.  The second case is studied with a fixed impermeable axial
velocity along the endwall and a combination axisymmetric steady and
non-axisymmetric unsteady radial velocity along the sidewall.
\end{singlespace}	% <-----------------------------


Usually you want to use a table produced by some other
software, such as Excel, rather than try to do it using
\LaTeX macros.  If the table is saved/printed to a PDF file,
then it can be displayed using the
$\backslash${\tt includegraphics} macro
inside a {\tt table} environment:


\begin{table}
    \caption[Table from a PDF file]{
	This table wasn't constructed with \LaTeX{}
	commands, but resides in PDF file
	({\tt tableD.pdf})
	created by some other software.
	}
    \begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=5.45in]{figs/tableD.pdf}
    \end{center}
\label{pdftable}
\end{table}


Some of the boundary conditions are:

\begin{eqnarray}
  z=0; && V_z = \twochoices
	{0, && t\leq0}
	{\widetilde{F}_{zw}(r,\theta,t), && t>0}
						\label{eq:endwall} \\
  z=0; && V_{\theta}=V_r=0			\label{eq:endnoslip} \\
  r=0; && P,\rho,T,V_r,\vth,V_z~\mbox{finite},	\label{eq:centerline} \\
  r=1; && V_r= F_{rws}(z),			\label{eq:injection} \\
  r=1; && V_z=\vth =0,				\label{eq:sidenoslip}
\end{eqnarray}
and solutions must be periodic in $\theta$.

\subsubsection{This is a subsubsection (1)}
This is the first paragraph of the subsubsection.
Whether it is numbered or inlined depends on the
option selected at the beginning of the
thesis.

By default, a \verb2\subsubsection2 heading is numbered
and set off on a separate line, left-justified.

\paragraph{However.}
Using the \verb2inlineh42 option, subsubsection headers
are inlined.
And using the \verb2nonumh42 option suppresses
numbering of the subsubsections.
Together they make subsubsection headings
just the same as paragraph headings.

Once again, whether its heading is numbered
and/or inlined depends on the class options
chosen at the start.

There is no ``subsubsubsection'' entity,
and ``subparagraph'' gets no special treatment
in \emph{thesis} class.

\section{The End}
\label{sec:end}

Finally, this is the end.  The bibliography starts on
the next page.
Note how the \verb2\hyperref2 package
(mentioned in chapter \ref{introchap})
also makes hyperlinks from references
(e.g., Mulick\cite{mulick})
to entries in the bibliography.
